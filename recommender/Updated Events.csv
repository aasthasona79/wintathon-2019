0,1,Nullcon Conference,"Nullcon was founded in 2010 with the idea of providing an integrated platform for exchanging information on the latest attack vectors, zero,day vulnerabilities and unknown threats. Our motto 'The neXt security thing!' drives the narrative of the conference, where security researchers and experts discuss and showcase the future of information security and the next,generation of offensiveand defensive security technology. The idea started as a gathering for researchers and organizations to brain storm and demonstrate why the current technology is not sufficient and what should be the focus for the coming years pertaining to information security.
In addition to security, one of the section of the conference called Desi Jugaad (Hindi for ""Local Hack"") is dedicated to hacking where we invite researchers who come up with innovative security / tech / non,tech solutions for solving real life challenges or taking up new initiatives.
Nullcon is managed and marketed by Payatu Technologies Pvt Ltd. The idea of nullcon emerged out of null , the open security community, a registered not,for, profit society and the largest active security community in India with over 8 chapters in major cities , Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Mysore, Trivandrum and Delhi. As a tribute to the community nullcon funds null to further null's cause and supports its initiatives. If you are interested in knowing how null can help your organization and would like to contribute to null, please get in touch with null team at info@null.co.in","Vikas Gupta, Nachiket Trivedi, Shila Trivedi, Raj Shah","CTF, Hacking, IoT, Python, JailBeak, Web Hacking, Android Hacking, Network Security, Computer Networks, Infrastructure Security, HTML/CSS, HTML5/CSS3, Javascipt, Pentesting, Windows, Linux, Kernel, Reverse Engineering, 3G/4G Security, WiFi Hacking, Side Channel Attacks, Lock Pick, Women Hacker, IDAPro, Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark, John The Ripper, Hashcat, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Shell Programming, Bash, Secure Software Development, Forencis, Information Security, Penetration testing, Computer forensics, Vulnerability assesment, Firewall, Security, Security Audit, Web Development, Android development, Server, Malware analysis, Wireless security, Social engineering, OWASP, Security Research, Cloud computing, Metasploit, Cyber security, dimtry, netdiscover, fping, tcpdump, wireshark, fetrace, traceroute, nslookup, host, anygryipscanner, dnsdict6, golismero, nikto, burpsuite, IDS, SQL Injection, XSS","Security Practitioners, Secuirty Analysts, Security Testers, Developers, Cryptographers, Hackers, Security Executives, CISO, CXO, Business Developers, Venture Capitalists, Presidents, Directors, Vice President, Consultants, Vendor Companies, Career Seekers, Recruiters, Academia, Professors, Students, Python Developers,","Goa, India",https://nullcon.net,01/03/2019 - 02/03/2019,"['ca', 'next', 'oi', 'hacking', 'c', 'r', 'c', 'hacking', 'python', 'python', 'java', 'network security', 'software development', 'programming', 'programming', 'c', 'linux', 'r', 'android', 'html', 'linux', 'sql', 'css', 'android', 'dns', 'cloud computing', 'ip', 'wireless', 'cyber', 'html', 'sql', 'c', 'testing', 'cyber security', 'tcp', 'cloud computing']",0.40066833799999996,0.42857142857142855
